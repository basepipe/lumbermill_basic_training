# Basic Navigation

Once lumbermill is set up you are ready to work.  

If you are syncing files you should now be able to navigate lumbermill easily and start working.  Simply Click through
the interface to quickly find what you need.  Lumbermill manages the folder structure under the hood, but presents things 
as simply as possible in the user interface.  Typically projects are presented as follows:

# Company Panel

# Projects Panel

# Assignments

# Shots/Assets

# Sequence/Categories
