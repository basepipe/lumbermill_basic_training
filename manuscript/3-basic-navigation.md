# The Magic File Browser

Imagine you had a magical file browser.  

When you used this magical file browser you found your tasks with 1-3 clicks.  It completely eliminated hunting through folders and searching for files for your tasks.  

This magical file browser did most of the work of your coordinators by constantly monitoring and updating your production management software for you.

It gave artists the ability to get their work reviewed with the click of a button.

It made versioning up tasks as easy as clicking, and ensured a record was kept of all the iterations worked on.

Your magical file browser could even ingest files from clients, and create deliveries when projects were completed.  

Wouldn't it be amazing?

It is.  We're building it at CG Lumberjack. 

Lumbermill is that magic file browser.   This is how it works.
