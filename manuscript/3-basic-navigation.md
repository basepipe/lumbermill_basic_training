# Basic Navigation

Once lumbermill is installed you are ready to work.  

If you are syncing files you should now be able to navigate lumbermill easily and start working.  Simply Click through

## Company Panel

### What is the Company Panel?
The Company Panel allows you to create different "Companies" for clients, or for simply keeping certain projects set apart from others.
At a minimum you should have one company reflecting your own company. You can put all the projects into that one company, but you always
have the option of creating a "company" for each client you work with, or for different aspects of your own studio that you'd like 
to keep seperate.  Often the deciding factor is if two different parts of your business have different folder structures
and project management needs.
