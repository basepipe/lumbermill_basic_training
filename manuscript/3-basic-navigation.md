# The Lumbermill Interface

Imagine if your File Browser was intelligent.  If it knew what you needed before you did.  If it was designed to get you where you needed to go with as few clicks as humanly possible. 

That's what Lumbermill does.  It packs all the functionality of a world class production studio into a simple to use interface.
