# Set up a Lumber-Sync Server {#set-up-lumber-sync-server}

Lumber-sync needs a server - this can be your computer or it can be an actual file server in a full studio set up.  What this basically means is that you need to designate a computer connected to your project storage as the server in lumbermill.   File sharing will happen from this computer.  Think of the Lumber-Sync Server as the "Hub" for all project information. 

To set up a Lumber-Sync server follow these steps:

1) [Configure AWS](#configure-aws)
1) Open Lumbermill
2) Ensure Auto-Start is set to On. 
    1) if Sync>Auto-Start: Off toggle it to On.
    1) Restart Lumbermill
3) Click Sync>Set up Server
4) This will go though a bunch of various things.

You are now set up to start Sharing Files with remote collaborators!
