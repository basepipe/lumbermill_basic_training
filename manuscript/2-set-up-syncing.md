# Lumber-Sync

Lumbermill has a syncing system designed for film production.  It allows companies to easily share
complex and large files with each other.  Since Lumbermill knows what's happening with all your files it can be smart
about which files and versions to sync, saving you a lot of time consuming syncing of versions you don't need.

## Setting up a Server to push stuff to artists.

Most productions have a central "hub" where all data is stored.  This can be a network storage server at a proper studio,
or simply your hard drive if you're a team of a few people.  The lumbermill server needs to be connected to the main storage for the project.
Tasks will be "pushed" from here, and all files will be gathered back to here. 

To set up a lumbermill server for your studio:

1) Open Lumbermill
2) Click Sync>Set up Server

You are now set up to start syncing files with remote collaborators.
