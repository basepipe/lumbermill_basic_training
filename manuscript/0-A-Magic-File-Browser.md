# Lumbermill - The Magic File Browser {#The-Magic-Browser}

What if you had a magic file browser. A file browser that was one part coordinator, one part IT department, another part producer, and was designed by artists?  And This Magic File Browser cared about one thing - making the life of everyone at the studio as easy as possible.

What if that magic file browser could organize your tasks, update status, create folders, and ensure every file was exactly where it needed to be while simultaneously keeping your project information up to date?

What if handled gathering information for dailies? All the review submissions, all the conversions, all the prep, all the tagging, all the headaches? 

What if it could organize and tag files coming in from clients, and connect those files to the production database?  What if it could just as easily any of the data you capture on set, with one click?

What if it allowed you to prevent errors and delays in production before they happened?  Without causing a rift in the space time continuum?

What if on top of all that this magic file browser had the ability to customize all of the software you use. What if it allowed you to embed your own custom, branded tools and menus into a host of different creative applications?  

This magic file browser exists, it's been brought to you by an inter-gallictic space lumberjack, and it's called "Lumbermill".
