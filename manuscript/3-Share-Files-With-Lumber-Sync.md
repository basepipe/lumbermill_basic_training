# Sharing Files with Lumber-Sync {#sharing-files}

As soon as you have 2 computers set up with Lumber-Sync you can start sharing files. 

Lumbermill is designed with a producer/artist workflow in mind.  Producers share existing files to remote artists through the sync browser.  

1) Open Lumbermill
2) Click Sync>Share Files
3) Select assets or shots
4) Select anything you'd like to share.
5) Click the "Sync" button

Artists iterate on tasks, and share them back to the producer through lumbermill's "publish" feature.

Remote artists simply have to publish their work in Lumbermill and it will automatically sync those publishes back to the correct location on disk on the server.
